<p>
  I am currently a freshman at NJIT majoring in Human-Computer Interactions.
I love this major because it combines computer science, design, and psychology, three fields I love and enjoy doing.
I hope to obtain a position as a UX designer, for it is a direct way to see how my projects impact and benefit
others in day-to-day living.
<br><br>
  I have always loved designing and creating,
having extensive experience with Adobe Suite and digital and traditional art.
I also enjoy programming, where I see my code become alive as a program.
Languages I know include Python, HTML, and CSS.
<br><br>
  I am currently interning as a technology assistant at a non-profit
  organization. Where I do graphic design and CAD, and I am also assisting
  with the creation of a coloring app. I have some UX experiences in the field in internships and projects I have done.
And I would love to build on top of that and gain more valuable experiences.
<br><br>
  In my free time, I also like to play video games,
and I am in the process of creating my own game. I also enjoy drawing and music.
I have done yearbook club throughout high school and newspaper club in college,
where I can continue to utilize my graphic design skills. I also enjoy teaching,
I have been teaching and tutoring since high school, and I am continuing it by teaching kids how to code.
